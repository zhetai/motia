# Motia Framework Architecture

Motia is a code-first framework for building event-driven workflows with zero infrastructure setup. The framework supports multiple languages (TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Ruby) and provides built-in observability.

## Core Components

1. Steps: Fundamental building blocks that contain isolated business logic
   - Event Steps: React to and emit events
   - API Steps: HTTP endpoints as workflow entry points
   - Cron Steps: Time-based workflow triggers
   - UI Steps: Visual components in the Workbench
   - NOOP Steps: Testing and development placeholders

2. Flows: Logical groupings of related steps
3. Events: Messages passed between steps
4. Topics: Named channels for event routing

## Project Structure
```typescript
my-motia-project/
├── steps/
│   ├── event-steps/
│   ├── api-steps/
│   └── cron-steps/
├── services/
├── middlewares/
├── utils/
```

## Step Creation Guidelines

1. Each step requires:
   - config object: Defines step properties
   - handler function: Contains business logic

2. Basic step configuration:
```typescript
export const config = {
  type: 'event|api|cron',
  name: 'unique-step-name',
  subscribes: ['topic1', 'topic2'],
  emits: ['output-topic'],
  flows: ['flow-name']
}

export const handler: StepHandler<typeof config> = async (input, context: FlowContext) => {
  // Business logic here
}
```

## General Guidelines
- Always follow functional programming best practices
- Avoid using `any`, use proper Typescript and prioritize using types from `@motiadev/core/dist/src/types.d.ts`
- Make sure all steps belong to the same flow
- Make sure the first step is an API step to only trigger the flow, all time-consuming tasks should belong to Event Steps to be processed in the background
- Steps need to have a `.step` suffix, for instance, for TS would be `my-step.step.ts`
- Make sure all step configurations have a `subscribe` and `emits` configurations so that they are all tied properly to a flow
- Always add tests to test steps in isolation, also add a flow test that tests the whole workflow
- Prioritize encapsulating business logic on services
- Try to put a single service per file, for instance, the file `getUsers.ts` exports a function `getUsers`
- Always check your code, make sure it builds (`npx motia build`) and runs properly (`npx motia dev`)

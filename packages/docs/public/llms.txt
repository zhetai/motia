# Command Line Interface (CLI)

Motia provides a powerful Command Line Interface (CLI) to help you manage your projects and workflows. The CLI offers various commands for creating projects, generating steps, managing state, and more.

## Installation

The Motia CLI is automatically installed when you install the `motia` package. You can use it by running `npx motia` followed by the desired command.

## Commands

### `create`

Create a new Motia project.

```bash
npx motia create [options]
```

Options:
- `-n, --name <project name>`: The name for your project, used to create a directory. Use `.` or `./` to create it in the current directory.
- `-t, --template <template name>`: The Motia template to use for your project. Run `npx motia templates` to see available templates.
- `-c, --cursor`: Enable Cursor IDE integration by adding `.cursor` configuration folder

### `templates`

Print the list of available project templates.

```bash
npx motia templates
```

### `build`

Build your project, generating zip files for each step and creating a configuration file.

```bash
npx motia build
```

This command:
1. Compiles all your steps (both Node.js and Python)
2. Bundles each step into a zip file
3. Generates a `motia.steps.json` configuration file in the `dist` directory
4. Organizes the output in the `dist` directory

### `deploy`

Deploy your built steps to the Motia deployment service.

```bash
npx motia deploy [options]
```

Options:
- `-k, --api-key <key>` (required): Your API key for authentication
- `-e, --env <environment>`: The environment to deploy to (default: `dev`)
- `-v, --version <version>`: The version to deploy (default: `latest`)

Example:
```bash
npx motia deploy --api-key your-api-key-here --env production --version 1.0.0
```

The deployment process:
1. Uploads each zip file individually with its path information
2. Uploads the steps configuration from `motia.steps.json`
3. Starts the deployment process on the server
4. Generates deployment results in `dist/motia.deployments.json`
5. Creates a human-readable summary in `dist/motia.deployments.summary.json`

### `dev`

Start the development server.

```bash
npx motia dev [options]
```

Options:
- `-p, --port <port>`: The port to run the server on (default: 3000).
- `-v, --verbose`: Enable verbose logging.
- `-d, --debug`: Enable debug logging.

### `get-config`

Get the generated config for your project.

```bash
npx motia get-config [options]
```

Options:
- `-o, --output <path>`: Path to write the generated config file.

### `emit`

Emit an event to the Motia server.

```bash
npx motia emit [options]
```

Options:
- `--topic <topic>` (required): Event topic/type to emit.
- `--message <message>` (required): Event payload as a JSON string.
- `-p, --port <number>`: Port number (default: 3000).

### `generate`

Generate Motia resources.

#### `generate step`

Create a new step with interactive prompts.

```bash
npx motia generate step [options]
```

Options:
- `-d, --dir <step file path>`: The path relative to the steps directory to create the step file.

### `state`

Manage application state.

#### `state list`

List the current file state.

```bash
npx motia state list
```
## Debugging

You can enable debug logging by passing the `-d` or `--debug` flag to the `dev` command:

```bash
npx motia dev --debug
```

This will set the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to `'debug'`, providing more detailed logging output.

# Deployment

Motia provides a robust deployment system that allows you to deploy your workflows to various environments. This guide explains the deployment architecture, process, and how to use the Motia CLI for deployments.

## Deployment Architecture

The Motia deployment system follows a three-step process:

1. **Upload Files**: Each zip file is uploaded individually with its relative path information
2. **Upload Configuration**: The `motia.steps.json` configuration is uploaded
3. **Start Deployment**: A request is sent to start the deployment process with the uploaded files and configuration

This approach provides several benefits:
- Better tracking of individual file uploads
- Separation of configuration from files
- Ability to retry specific parts of the deployment if needed
- More efficient server-side processing
- Ensures all files are successfully uploaded before proceeding

## Using the Motia CLI for Deployment

The simplest way to deploy your Motia workflows is using the CLI command:

```bash
motia deploy --api-key <api-key> --environment <environment> --version <version>
```

### Command Options

| Option | Alias | Description | Default |
|--------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `--environment` | `-e` | Target environment for deployment | `development` |
| `--version` | `-v` | Version tag for the deployment | Current timestamp |
| `--api-key` | `-k` | API key for authentication (required) | None |

### Examples

Deploy to the development environment with an auto-generated version:

```bash
motia deploy --api-key your-api-key-here
```

Deploy to production with a specific version:

```bash
motia deploy --environment production --version 1.2.3 --api-key your-api-key-here
```

## Deployment Results

After deployment, two files are generated in your project directory:

### 1. motia.deployments.json

Contains detailed information about each deployment attempt, including:
- Bundle path
- Deployment ID
- Step type
- Step name
- Step path
- Flow name
- Environment
- Version
- Success status
- Error message (if any)

### 2. motia.deployments.summary.json

A more human-readable summary organized by flows:
- Total steps deployed
- Successful deployments count
- Failed deployments count
- Deployment timestamp
- Environment
- Version
- List of flows with their steps and deployment status

## Deployment Process

When you run `motia deploy`, the CLI performs the following actions:

1. **Preparation**: Validates your project structure and configuration
2. **File Collection**: Gathers all workflow step zip files from your project
3. **File Upload**: Uploads each zip file to the Motia platform
4. **Configuration Upload**: Uploads your workflow configuration
5. **Deployment Initiation**: Starts the deployment process on the server
6. **Status Reporting**: Provides feedback on deployment progress and results

The CLI will display progress information during deployment and a summary when complete.

## Troubleshooting Deployments

If you encounter issues during deployment, try these steps:

1. Check the generated deployment files for specific error messages
2. Ensure your API key has the correct permissions
3. Verify your project structure follows Motia's requirements
4. Check that all required files are present and correctly formatted

title: Flows
---

A **Flow** allows you to group [**steps**](/docs/concepts/steps/defining-steps), making it seamless to visually map out how events move through a sequence of [steps](/docs/concepts/steps/defining-steps). While flows are technically optional, they're invaluable for:

- **Clarity**: Understand how [**steps**](/docs/concepts/steps/defining-steps) interact with each other at a glance
- **Visualization**: Get a visual representation of event flow across your [**steps**](/docs/concepts/steps/defining-steps)
- **Observability**: Group logs and events by flow name for easier debugging

### Creating and Tagging Steps with a Flow

Flows are defined by tagging your [steps](/docs/concepts/steps/defining-steps) with a flow name. Here's how to associate [steps](/docs/concepts/steps/defining-steps) with a flow:

```js
// addNumbers.step.js
exports.config = {
  type: 'event',
  name: 'AddNumbers',
  subscribes: ['add-numbers'],
  emits: ['numbers-added'],
  flows: ['calculator-flow'], // <-- Flow association
}

// ... handler definition
```

You can create complex workflows by connecting multiple [steps](/docs/concepts/steps/defining-steps) within the same flow:

```js
// validateNumbers.step.js
exports.config = {
  type: 'event',
  name: 'ValidateNumbers',
  subscribes: ['numbers-added'],
  emits: ['numbers-validated'],
  flows: ['calculator-flow'], // <-- Same flow name connects the steps
}

// ... handler definition
```

<Callout type="info">
  💡 Best Practices: - Use descriptive flow names that reflect their purpose (e.g., 'user-registration-flow',
  'payment-processing-flow') - A [step](/docs/concepts/steps/defining-steps) can belong to multiple flows: `flows:
  ['billing-flow', 'analytics-flow']` - Keep flows focused on specific business processes for better organization
</Callout>

### Visualizing Your Flows

After you've defined your flows, you can visualize them in [Motia Workbench](/docs/workbench/overview).

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Start your development server:

    <Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm', 'bun']}>
      <Tab value="yarn">```yarn run dev ```</Tab>
      <Tab value="npm">```npm run dev ```</Tab>
      <Tab value="pnpm">```pnpm run dev ```</Tab>
      <Tab value="bun">```bun run dev ```</Tab>
    </Tabs>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    [Open](http://localhost:3000) Motia Workbench in your browser (typically at `http://localhost:3000` or `http://127.0.0.1:3000`).
    ![Flow Visualization in Workbench](./../img/demo-workbench.png)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Navigate** to your flow name on the left sidebar and click it. You'll see a visual graph where each [**step**](/docs/concepts/steps/defining-steps) is represented as a node, with connecting lines showing event flow patterns.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Click** on any [**step**](/docs/concepts/steps/defining-steps) node to inspect its configuration details, including name, emits, subscribes, and other properties.
  </Step>
</Steps>

            })
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Running and Debugging

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Start the Dev Server

    1. Navigate to your Motia project root folder
    2. Start the development server:

    <Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm', 'bun']}>
      <Tab value="yarn">```yarn run dev ```</Tab>
      <Tab value="npm">```npm run dev ```</Tab>
      <Tab value="pnpm">```pnpm run dev ```</Tab>
      <Tab value="bun">```bun run dev ```</Tab>
    </Tabs>

    3. You can monitor logs in two ways:
      - Open [Motia Workbench](http://localhost:3000), select your flow, and expand the logs container
      - View logs directly in the terminal where you ran the dev command
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### Trigger and Monitor Flows

    You can trigger flows using either the CLI or an [API step](/docs/concepts/steps/api):

    <Tabs items={['cli', 'api']}>
      <Tab value='cli'>
      ```bash
      npx motia emit --topic <topic> --message '{}'
      ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value='api'>
      ```bash
      curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/<api-step-path> \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{}'
      ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### Debug Using Logs

    Each log entry automatically includes:

    - `timestamp`: When the log was generated
    - `traceId`: Unique identifier for the flow execution
    - `flows`: Array of flow names this step belongs to
    - `file`: Source file generating the log
    - `level`: Log level
    - `msg`: Log message
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### Stopping the development server
    Press **Ctrl + C** (or **Cmd + C** on macOS) in your terminal. That's it!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

### Structured Logging

```typescript
// Good - Structured and searchable
logger.info('Payment processed', {
  paymentId: '123',
  amount: 100,
  status: 'success',
})

// Avoid - Harder to parse and search
logger.info(`Payment ${paymentId} processed: amount=${amount}`)
```

### Performance Monitoring

```typescript
export const handler: Handlers['StepName'] = async (input, { logger }) => {
  const startTime = performance.now()

  // Process operation
  const result = await processOperation(input)

  logger.info('Operation completed', {
    duration: performance.now() - startTime,
    memoryUsage: process.memoryUsage().heapUsed,
  })
}
```

### Debugging Tips

1. Add detailed context to error logs:

```typescript
logger.error('Operation failed', {
  error: error.message,
  code: error.code,
  input: JSON.stringify(input),
  stack: error.stack,
})
```

2. Use debug logs for detailed troubleshooting:

```typescript
logger.debug('Operation details', {
  rawInput: input,
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  state: currentState,
})
```

<Callout>
  Remember to stop your development server with Ctrl + C (or Cmd + C on macOS) when you're done debugging.

title: State Management
description: Learn how to manage state within your Motia.dev workflows for persistent data and cross-step communication.
---

State management is fundamental to building robust and dynamic workflows in Motia.dev. Our system is designed to be powerful yet simple, providing you with everything you need to maintain state across your flows and steps:

✨ **Zero Configuration (Default):** In-memory storage out of the box for quick setup. <br />
🔌 **Flexible Storage Options:** Choose from Memory, File, and Redis adapters to suit your persistence needs. <br />
🧹 **Automatic State Cleanup:** Optional Time-To-Live (TTL) support for automatic state expiration (Redis). <br />
🔒 **Built-in Isolation:** Each flow execution can use its own isolated state, ensuring data separation and security. <br />

## Core Concepts: State Manager Methods

The `state` object, accessible within your step handlers via the `ctx` context, provides the following methods for state management:

| Method    | Parameters                             | Return Type          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `get`     | `scope: string, key: string`           | `Promise<T \| null>` | Retrieves a value associated with the given `key` and `scope` from the state store. Returns `null` if the key is not found. The type `T` is inferred based on how you use the returned value. |
| `set`     | `scope: string, key: string, value: T` | `Promise<void>`      | Stores a `value` associated with the given `key` and `scope` in the state store. The type `T` can be any serializable JavaScript/JSON value.                                                  |
| `delete`  | `scope: string, key: string`           | `Promise<void>`      | Removes the key-value pair associated with the given `key` and `scope` from the state store.                                                                                                  |
| `clear`   | `scope: string`                        | `Promise<void>`      | Removes **all** state data associated with the provided `scope`. This is useful for cleaning up state for a specific scope.                                                                   |
| `cleanup` | _(None)_                               | `Promise<void>`      | Performs periodic maintenance tasks, such as removing expired state data (TTL cleanup). The actual implementation depends on the configured state adapter.                                    |

**Important:** State manager methods (`get`, `set`, `delete`, `clear`) **require a `scope` string as the first parameter.** While in most cases, you will use the `traceId` (automatically provided in `ctx.traceId`) as the scope to ensure flow-level isolation, **you can technically use any string value as the scope** to group and manage state data as needed. Using `traceId` is the recommended and most common practice for flow-isolated state.

### State Scope and Isolation

Each flow execution in Motia.dev is assigned a unique `traceId` (a UUID). Using this `traceId` as the **scope** for state management provides automatic isolation, ensuring: _(Revised to clarify `traceId` as scope)_

| Feature        | Description                                                                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Isolation**  | Each flow execution operates within its own isolated state space when using `traceId` as the scope.                 |
| **Boundaries** | Clear separation of state data between different flow executions when scoped by `traceId`, preventing interference. |
| **Cleanup**    | State data scoped by `traceId` can be easily cleared using `state.clear(traceId)`.                                  |

### State Structure Example

State data is stored as key-value pairs, namespaced under a scope string. When using `traceId` as the scope, the internal structure might look like this:

```typescript
// Example state structure (internal representation) - using traceId as scope
{
  "motia:state:{traceId-123}": {  // State for flow execution with traceId 'traceId-123' (scope)
    "booking": {                 // Namespaced key 'booking'
      "customer": { ... },
      "venue": { ... }
    },
    "payment": {                 // Namespaced key 'payment'
      "status": "pending",
      "amount": 100
    }
  },
  "motia:state:{traceId-456}": {  // State for another flow execution with traceId 'traceId-456' (different scope)
    // ... different state data for this flow ...
  }
}
```

> **Info:** You can access the `state` manager within any step through the `ctx` (context) argument, which is automatically injected into your [step handler](/docs/concepts/steps/defining-steps#handler). While **`traceId` from `ctx.traceId` is the recommended scope for flow isolation**, remember that **you can use any string as the scope** parameter in `state` methods for more advanced state management scenarios.

## Debugging

### Inspecting State

<Tabs items={['Memory', 'File', 'Redis']}>
  <Tab label="Memory">
    > State is only available during runtime in the Node.js process memory. You cannot inspect memory state directly outside of a running step execution. Use logging within your steps to output state values for debugging purposes.
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="File">
    To inspect state stored in the **File Adapter**, you can directly view the contents of the state file using the Motia CLI:

    ```bash
    # View state file contents
    motia state list
    ```

    This command will output the entire state file (motia.state.json) content in JSON format to your console, allowing you to examine the stored state data.

  </Tab>
  <Tab label="Redis">
    To inspect state stored in **Redis Adapter**, you can use the `redis-cli` command-line tool to interact with your Redis server:

    ```bash
    # List all state keys (under the motia:state prefix)
    redis-cli KEYS "motia:state:*"

    # Get specific state for a given traceId and key
    redis-cli GET "motia:state:{traceId}:booking"
    ```
    **Note:** Replace `{traceId}` in the `redis-cli GET` command with the actual `traceId` of the flow execution you are debugging. Replace `booking` with the specific `key` you want to inspect.

</Tabs>

## Best Practices

### Namespacing

Use dot notation to organize related state data hierarchically:

<Tabs items={['TypeScript', 'JavaScript', 'Python']}>
  <Tab label="TypeScript">
    ```typescript
    // Good - Organized hierarchically (using traceId scope)
    await state.set(traceId, 'booking.customer', customerData)
    await state.set(traceId, 'booking.venue', venueData)
    await state.set(traceId, 'payment.status', 'pending')

    // Avoid - Flat structure (using traceId scope)
    await state.set(traceId, 'customer', customerData)
    await state.set(traceId, 'venue', venueData)
    await state.set(traceId, 'paymentStatus', 'pending')
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab label="JavaScript">
    ```javascript
    // Good - Organized hierarchically (using traceId scope)
    await state.set(traceId, 'booking.customer', customerData)
    await state.set(traceId, 'booking.venue', venueData)
    await state.set(traceId, 'payment.status', 'pending')

    // Avoid - Flat structure (using traceId scope)
    await state.set(traceId, 'customer', customerData)
    await state.set(traceId, 'venue', venueData)
    await state.set(traceId, 'paymentStatus', 'pending')
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Python">
    ```python
    # Good - Organized hierarchically (using traceId scope)
    await ctx.state.set(trace_id, 'booking.customer', customer_data)
    await ctx.state.set(trace_id, 'booking.venue', venue_data)
    await ctx.state.set(trace_id, 'payment.status', 'pending')

    // Avoid - Flat structure (using traceId scope)
    await ctx.state.set(trace_id, 'customer', customer_data)
    await ctx.state.set(trace_id, 'venue', venue_data)
    await ctx.state.set(trace_id, 'payment_status', 'pending')
    ```

### Type Safety

Define types for your state data to ensure consistency:

<Tabs items={['TypeScript', 'JavaScript', 'Python']}>
  <Tab label="TypeScript">
    ```typescript
    interface CustomerData {
      name: string;
      email: string;
    }

    interface VenueData {
      id: string;
      capacity: number;
    }

    type BookingState = {
      customer: CustomerData;
      venue: VenueData;
      status: 'pending' | 'confirmed';
    }

    const booking = await state.get<BookingState>(traceId, 'booking')
    ```

  </Tab>

{' '}
<Tab label="JavaScript">
  ```javascript // Define types or interfaces as needed for documentation clarity (optional in JS) const booking = await
  state.get(traceId, 'booking') // No type casting in JS example ```
</Tab>

  <Tab label="Python">
    ```python
    from dataclasses import dataclass
    from typing import Literal

    @dataclass
    class CustomerData:
        name: str
        email: str

    @dataclass
    class VenueData:
        id: str
        capacity: int

    @dataclass
    class BookingState:
        customer: CustomerData
        venue: VenueData
        status: Literal['pending', 'confirmed']

    booking = await state.get(traceId, 'booking')

### Cleanup

Always clean up state when you're done with it:

          // Clean up specific keys
          await state.delete(traceId, 'booking.customer')
          // Or clean everything
          await state.clear(traceId)
        } catch (error) {

### Performance Considerations

| Consideration    | Description                                                          |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Batch Operations | Group related state updates and use atomic operations when possible  |
| State Size       | Keep state data minimal and consider access patterns                 |
| TTL Management   | Set appropriate TTLs based on flow duration and error recovery needs |

### Custom State Adapters

```typescript title="Custom State Adapter Example"
import { StateAdapter } from 'motia'

class CustomStateAdapter extends StateAdapter {
  async get<T>(traceId: string, key: string): Promise<T | null> {
    // Implementation
    return null
  }

  async set<T>(traceId: string, key: string, value: T): Promise<void> {
    // Implementation
  }

  async delete(traceId: string, key: string): Promise<void> {
    // Implementation
  }

  async clear(traceId: string): Promise<void> {
    // Implementation
  }

  async cleanup(): Promise<void> {
    // Implementation
  }
}
```

### Storage Adapters

Motia.dev offers three built-in storage adapters:

- 📁 **File (Default):** Persists state to a JSON file in your project (`.motia/motia.state.json`). No configuration needed for basic use.
- 💾 **Memory:** Stores state in-memory. Fastest option, but state is not persistent across server restarts. Useful for development and non-critical data.
- ⚡ **Redis:** Leverages Redis for persistent and scalable state storage. Ideal for production environments and flows requiring high availability and data durability.

To configure a different state adapter, modify the `config.yml` file in your project root:

```
my-project/
├── config.yml
└── steps/
    ├── step-1.ts
    └── step-2.ts
```

**File Adapter (Default)**

> Default, no configuration required, state is stored into .motia/motia.state.json in your project root

**Memory Adapter**

```yaml title="config.yml"
state:
  adapter: memory
```

> **Warning: Memory Adapter**
> State is stored in-memory and will be lost when the Motia.dev server restarts. Suitable for development and testing.

**Redis Adapter**

```yaml title="config.yml"
state:
  adapter: redis
  host: localhost # Redis server host (e.g., 'localhost' or IP address)
  port: 6379 # Redis server port (default: 6379)
  password: optional # Redis password (if required)
  ttl: 3600 # Optional: State Time-To-Live in seconds (e.g., 3600 seconds = 1 hour)
```

> **Info: Redis Adapter**
> Recommended for production environments. Requires a running Redis server. The `ttl` (Time-To-Live) option is available to automatically expire state data after a specified number of seconds, helping to manage Redis storage.

| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| State Not Found   | - Verify state adapter configuration\n- Check TTL expiration (Redis)\n- Ensure file permissions (File adapter)\n- **Ensure correct `traceId` is being used in `state.get(traceId, key)` calls.** |
| Persistence       | - Memory adapter: State is lost on process restart\n- File adapter: Check file write permissions\n- Redis: Verify connection and persistence settings                                            |
| Concurrent Access | - Memory/File: Limited concurrent flow support\n- Redis: Use atomic operations and implement retry logic                                                                                         |

title: API Step
---

An **API step** is exposed as an HTTP endpoint that acts as an entry point into your sequence of steps, or **flow**. It allows external systems or clients to trigger and interact with your flows through a REST API interface. Like any Motia Step, an API Step can be configured to emit events or wait for events to occur.

## Config

The following examples showcase how to configure an **API Step**

## Using Middleware

API Steps support middleware functions that can be applied to requests before they reach your handler. Middleware functions are completely framework-agnostic and can perform tasks such as:

- Authentication and authorization
- Request logging
- Rate limiting
- CORS handling
- Request validation
- Response transformation

### Middleware Function Signature

```typescript
type ApiMiddleware = (req: ApiRequest, ctx: FlowContext, next: () => Promise<ApiResponse>) => Promise<ApiResponse>
```

Middleware functions receive:

- `req`: The API request object with body, headers, pathParams, and queryParams
- `ctx`: The flow context with logger, state, emit, and traceId
- `next`: A function to call the next middleware or handler in the chain
  - Call `next()` to continue to the next middleware or handler
  - The return value of `next()` is the response from the next middleware or handler
  - You can modify this response before returning it

### Example Middleware Usage

```typescript
import { ApiMiddleware } from 'motia'

// Logging middleware
const loggingMiddleware: ApiMiddleware = async (req, ctx, next) => {
  ctx.logger.info('Request received', { path: req.pathParams })
  const start = Date.now()

  // Call the next middleware and get its response
  const response = await next()

  const duration = Date.now() - start
  ctx.logger.info('Request completed', { duration, status: response.status })

  return response
}

// Authentication middleware
const authMiddleware: ApiMiddleware = async (req, ctx, next) => {
  const authHeader = req.headers.authorization

  if (!authHeader) {
    // Return early without calling next()
    return {
      status: 401,
      body: { error: 'Unauthorized' },
    }
  }

  // Continue to the next middleware
  return next()
}

export const config = {
  type: 'api',
  name: 'protected-endpoint',
  path: '/api/protected',
  method: 'POST',
  emits: ['USER_ACTION'],
  middleware: [loggingMiddleware, authMiddleware],
}

export const handler = async (req, ctx) => {
  // This handler will only be called if all middleware pass
  return {
    status: 200,
    body: { message: 'Protected data accessed successfully' },
  }
}
```

### Creating Custom Middleware

You can create your own middleware functions:

```typescript
import { ApiMiddleware } from 'motia'

// Request modification middleware
const requestModifierMiddleware: ApiMiddleware = async (req, ctx, next) => {
  // Modify the request before passing it to the next middleware
  req.headers['x-modified-by'] = 'middleware'
  req.body.timestamp = Date.now()

  // Call the next middleware in the chain
  return next()
}

// Response modification middleware
const responseModifierMiddleware: ApiMiddleware = async (req, ctx, next) => {
  // Call the next middleware in the chain
  const response = await next()

  // Modify the response before returning it
  response.headers = {
    ...response.headers,
    'x-powered-by': 'Motia',
  }

  return response
}

// Error handling middleware
const errorHandlingMiddleware: ApiMiddleware = async (req, ctx, next) => {
  try {
    // Call the next middleware in the chain
    return await next()
  } catch (error) {
    ctx.logger.error('Error in handler', { error })
    return {
      status: 500,
      body: { error: 'Internal server error' },
    }
  }
}

// Rate limiter middleware with state
const rateLimiterMiddleware: ApiMiddleware = (() => {
  // Closure to maintain state between requests
  const requests: Record<string, number[]> = {}
  const limit = 100
  const windowMs = 60000 // 1 minute

  return async (req, ctx, next) => {
    const ip = req.headers['x-forwarded-for'] || 'unknown-ip'
    const ipStr = Array.isArray(ip) ? ip[0] : ip

    const now = Date.now()
    if (!requests[ipStr]) {
      requests[ipStr] = []
    }

    // Remove old requests outside the time window
    requests[ipStr] = requests[ipStr].filter((time) => now - time < windowMs)

-   [Defining Steps](/docs/concepts\steps\defining-steps.md): Documentation for Defining Steps.
---
title: Defining Steps
---

Steps are the fundamental building blocks in Motia that encapsulate isolated pieces of business logic. 

Steps have two core behaviors:

1. **Event Subscription**: Steps can subscribe to specific topics, allowing them to listen and react to particular events.
2. **Event Emission**: Steps can emit new topics, triggering an event for other steps to react to.

Steps can operate in two different patterns:
- **Independent**: Each step can function as a standalone unit, processing its logic in isolation.
- **Flow**: Steps can be connected together in a sequence, creating a **flow** where the output of one step becomes the input for another.

This modular approach allows you to:
- Build reusable components of business logic
- Create complex workflows by combining simple steps
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Scale and modify parts of your system independently

Steps can be defined in any language that Motia supports, such as TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python. Steps can be of type [`event`](/docs/concepts/steps/event), [`api`](/docs/concepts/steps/api), or [`cron`](/docs/concepts/steps/cron). Steps are composed of a `config` object and a `handler` function.

## Config

A step's configuration is defined through a `config` object that must be exported. This object contains essential properties that tell Motia how to interact with the step.

<DescriptionTable
  type={{
    type: {
      description: 'The step type: event, api, or cron',
      type: 'string',
    },
    name: {
      description: 'A unique identifier for the step, used in Motia Workbench visualization tool',
      type: 'string',
    },
    subscribes: {
      description: 'A list of topics this step listens to',
      type: 'string[]',
      default: []
    },
    emits: {
      description: 'A list of topics this step can emit',
      type: 'string[]',
    },
    flows: {
      description: 'A list of flow identifiers that this step belongs to',
      type: 'string[]',
    },
    description: {
      description: 'Optional description for documentation and visualization',
      type: 'string',
    }
  }}
/>

Each step type has its own set of properties, specific to that step type, which are described in the following sections.

<Breadcrumb items={[{
  name: 'Event Steps',
  url: '/docs/concepts/steps/event'
}, {
  name: 'API Steps',
  url: '/docs/concepts/steps/api'
}, {
  name: 'Cron Steps',
  url: '/docs/concepts/steps/cron'
}]} />

## Handler

A handler holds the business logic of a step. When an event occurs that matches the step's subscribed topics, the handler automatically runs with two key pieces of information:

1. The input data from the triggering event
2. A context object that provides useful tools:
   - `emit`: Sends new events to other steps
   - `traceId`: Helps track the flow of operations
   - `state`: Manages data persistence
   - `logger`: Records important information

Here're examples of how to define a handler in the Motia supported languages:

## Example


-   [streams](/docs/concepts\streams.md): Documentation for streams.
---
title: Streams 
description: Motia Streams are a way to quickly push updates from your asynchronous workflows to the client without having to implement any sort of polling processes.
---

## How it works

You first need to define a stream in your project

### Defining a stream

To be able to use Motia Sockets, you need to define a stream

Create a file called `open-ai.stream.ts` under `steps/` folder

```typescript
import { StateStreamConfig } from 'motia'
import { z } from 'zod'

export const config: StateStreamConfig = {
  /**
   * This will be converted in the property on the FlowContext:
   * 
   * context.streams.openai
   */
  name: 'openai',
  /**
   * Schema is important to define the type of the stream, the API
   * generated to interact with this stream will have the structure defined here
   */  
  schema: z.object({ message: z.string() }),

  /**
   * Base config is used to configure the stream
   */
  baseConfig: {
    /**
     * There are two storage types: state and custom
     * State will use the state manager to store the data.
     * 
     * Custom will use a custom storage, you need to implement 
     * the StateStream class.
     */
    storageType: 'state',
  },
}
```

Once a stream is created, it should be immediately available in FlowContext (make sure to have motia running on the project)

Then you can simply create records using the streams API in your step

```typescript
import { ApiRouteConfig, Handlers } from 'motia'
import { z } from 'zod'

export const config: ApiRouteConfig = {
  type: 'api',
  name: 'OpenAiApi',
  description: 'Call OpenAI',
  path: '/open-ai',
  method: 'POST',
  emits: ['openai-prompt'],
  flows: ['open-ai'],
  bodySchema: z.object({ message: z.string({ description: 'The message to send to OpenAI' }) }),
  responseSchema: {
    200: z.object({ message: z.string({ description: 'The message from OpenAI' }) }) 
  },
}

export const handler: Handlers['OpenAiApi'] = async (req, { traceId, logger, emit, streams }) => {
  logger.info('[Call OpenAI] Received callOpenAi event', { message: req.body.message })

  /**
   * This creates a record with empty message string to be populated in the next step
   */
  const result = await streams.openai.set(traceId, 'message', { message: '' })

  await emit({
    topic: 'openai-prompt',
    data: { message: req.body.message },
  })

  return { status: 200, body: result }
}
```

The previous step just prepares a message to be created by Open AI via OpenAI SDK stream, which will be populated in the next step

```typescript
import { EventConfig, Handlers } from 'motia'
import { OpenAI } from 'openai'
import { z } from 'zod'

export const config: EventConfig = {
  type: 'event',
  name: 'CallOpenAi',
  description: 'Call OpenAI',
  subscribes: ['openai-prompt'],
  emits: [],
  input: z.object({
    message: z.string({ description: 'The message to send to OpenAI' }),
  }),
  flows: ['open-ai'],
}

export const handler: Handlers['CallOpenAi'] = async (input, context) => {
  const { logger, traceId } = context
  const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY })

  logger.info('[Call OpenAI] Received callOpenAi event', input)

  const result = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    messages: [{ role: 'system', content: input.message }],
    model: 'gpt-4o-mini',
    stream: true,
  })

  const messages: string[] = []

  for await (const chunk of result) {
    messages.push(chunk.choices[0].delta.content ?? '')

    /**
     * Now we're populating a previously created message with the streamed data from OpenAI
     */
    await context.streams.openai.set(traceId, 'message', { 
      message: messages.join(''),
    })
  }

  logger.info('[Call OpenAI] OpenAI response', result)
}
```

## Testing Streams in Workbench

We know testing real time events is not easy as a backend developer, so we've added a way to test streams in the Workbench.

Here are the steps to test streams in the Workbench:

1. The API Step that provides a stream item should return the object

```typescript
export const handler: Handlers['OpenAiApi'] = async (req, { traceId, logger, emit, streams }) => {
  logger.info('[Call OpenAI] Received callOpenAi event', { message: req.body.message })

  /**
   * This creates a record with empty message string to be populated in the next step
   */
  const result = await streams.openai.set(traceId, 'message', { message: '' })

  await emit({
    topic: 'openai-prompt',
    data: { message: req.body.message },
  })

  /**
   * Return the entire object received from the create method
   */
  return { status: 200, body: result }
}
```

2. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/endpoints](http://localhost:3000/endpoints) in your Workbench
3. Open up your endpoint and click on the `Test` button
4. The result will automatically be streamed from the server to the client streaming it's state real-time.

![Stream Test in Workbench](./../img/streams-test-workbench.gif)


## Consuming stream on the browser

```
npm install @motiadev/stream-client-react
```

Then add the provider to the root of your project

```tsx
<MotiaStreamProvider address="ws://localhost:3000">
  ...
</MotiaStreamProvider>
```

then on your component or hook, just use

```typescript
const messageId = '' // get the id back from the API call

// data below will be updated whenever it's updated in the server
const { data } = useStreamItem({ 
  streamName: 'openai',
  groupId: messageId,
  id: 'message'
})
```

# Testing

Testing is an essential part of building reliable and maintainable Motia applications. Motia provides built-in support for writing and running tests to ensure the correctness of your steps, flows, and event handling logic.

## Writing Tests for Motia Components

Motia uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as its testing framework. You can write tests for your Motia components using Jest's syntax and assertions.

### Step Tests

To test a step, create a test file with the same name as the step file, but with a `.test.ts` or `.test.js` extension. For example, if your step file is named `my-step.step.ts`, create a test file named `my-step.step.test.ts`.

Here's an example of a step test:

```typescript
// my-step.step.test.ts
import { createTestContext } from '@motiadev/testing'
import { handler } from './my-step.step'

describe('MyStep', () => {
  it('should emit an event with the correct data', async () => {
    const { emit, done } = createTestContext()

    await handler({ name: 'John' }, { emit })

    expect(emit).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
      type: 'my-event',
      data: { greeting: 'Hello, John!' },
    })

    done()
  })
})
```

In this example, we use the `createTestContext` function from `@motiadev/testing` to create a test context with mocked `emit` and `done` functions. We then call the step's `handler` function with test input and the mocked context. Finally, we assert that the `emit` function was called with the expected event type and data.

### Flow Tests

To test a flow, create a test file with the flow name and a `.test.ts` or `.test.js` extension. For example, if your flow is named `my-flow`, create a test file named `my-flow.test.ts`.

Here's an example of a flow test:

```typescript
// my-flow.test.ts
import { createTestFlow } from '@motiadev/testing'
import { handler as stepAHandler } from './step-a.step'
import { handler as stepBHandler } from './step-b.step'

describe('MyFlow', () => {
  it('should execute steps in the correct order', async () => {
    const flow = createTestFlow('my-flow')
      .step('step-a', stepAHandler)
      .step('step-b', stepBHandler)

    const result = await flow.execute({ name: 'Alice' })

    expect(result).toEqual({
      greeting: 'Hello, Alice!',
      message: 'Welcome to Motia!',
    })
  })
})
```

In this example, we use the `createTestFlow` function from `@motiadev/testing` to create a test flow with the specified steps. We then execute the flow with test input and assert that the final result matches the expected output.

## Running Tests Locally

To run tests locally, use the following command:

```bash
pnpm test
```

This command will run all the test files in your project and display the test results in the terminal.

You can also run tests in watch mode, which automatically re-runs the tests whenever you make changes to your code:

```bash
pnpm test --watch
```

## Best Practices

- Write tests for each step and flow to ensure comprehensive coverage.
- Use meaningful test case descriptions to clarify the purpose of each test.
- Test edge cases and error scenarios to ensure your components handle them gracefully.
- Keep your tests focused and independent to make them easier to maintain.
- Use mocks and stubs to isolate dependencies and improve test reliability.

By following these best practices and regularly running tests, you can catch bugs early, maintain code quality, and ensure the reliability of your Motia application.

Sometimes you don't just want a **simple** "prompt => response." Instead, you want the LLM to decide how to proceed. Below is a minimal example that:

1. Receives user input via `POST /api/analyze-sentiment`
2. Calls OpenAI and **instructs** the LLM to return JSON with a `sentiment` field
3. Parses that JSON and **emits** different events depending on whether `sentiment` is `"positive"` or `"negative"` (or anything else)
4. Two specialized responders handle each sentiment separately

## Visual Overview

Here's how the events chain together:

<div className="my-8">![Flow: Sentiment Analysis Steps](./../img/sentiment-analyzer.png)</div>

1. **Analyze Sentiment (API)** → emits `openai.analyzeSentimentRequest`
2. **OpenAI Sentiment Analyzer** → calls OpenAI, parses JSON →
   - If `sentiment: "positive"` → emits `openai.positiveSentiment`
   - Else → emits `openai.negativeSentiment`
3. **Positive Sentiment Responder** or **Negative Sentiment Responder**

---

## Trying It Out

<Steps>

### Install Dependencies

```shell
pnpm install motia openai
```

### Create Project Structure

<Folder name="steps" defaultOpen>
  <File name="analyzeSentimentApi.step.ts" />
  <File name="openAiAnalyzeSentiment.step.ts" />
  <File name="handlePositive.step.ts" />
  <File name="handleNegative.step.ts" />
</Folder>

### Set Environment Variables

```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

### Run the Project

```shell
pnpm motia dev
```

### Test the API

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/analyze-sentiment \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"I absolutely love this new device!"}'
```

Check your logs - you should see either the `[Positive Responder]` or `[Negative Responder]` step firing, depending on the LLM's JSON output.

### Extend Further

Here are some ways to build upon this example:

- Tweak the system instructions to force certain outputs or include more details
- Create more specialized responders (like "neutralSentiment")
- Integrate a notification step (Slack, database, etc.)

</Steps>

Try it out, see the branching logic in action, and enjoy skipping all the boring boilerplate!

# Building Blocks of Motia

To effectively build and utilize Motia, it's essential to grasp its foundational concepts. Motia workflows are built upon three building blocks that work together to create powerful and flexible automation solutions: **API**, **Event**, **Cron**, **Noop**. They're all represented as **Steps**.

## Everything is a Step

As mentioned above, Motia has four primitives, API Step, Event Step, Cron Step, Noop Steps. They're all steps on a Workflow and can be connected.

## What is a Step?

Steps are arbitraty executable functions that run based on a certain criteria.

1. **API Steps**: Run whenever an HTTP endpoint defined in your workflow is called. These steps allow external systems or clients to trigger automated processes within Motia.
2. **Event Steps**: Run whenever an event is emitted to a subscribed topic. These steps allow your workflow to react to changes or actions occurring within the Motia system.
3. **Cron Steps**: Run automatically based on a defined schedule, such as "every day at 1pm", according to a cron expression. These steps are ideal for automating recurring tasks.
4. **Noop Steps**: "Noop" stands for "No operation." These steps contain no logic and are used to represent actions that occur outside the Motia ecosystem, such as manual tasks or external processes.

## Example Step Types

- **API Step:** Exposes an HTTP endpoint to trigger a flow from external systems.
- **Event Step:** Executes logic in response to a specific event within the Motia system.
- **Cron Step:** Schedules tasks to run at specific intervals based on cron expressions.
- **Noop Step:** Represents a placeholder for external processes or manual tasks, useful for visualization and workflow modeling.

**➡️ [Learn More about Defining Steps](/docs/concepts/steps/defining-steps)**

## Flows: Orchestrating Your Workflows

Steps are connected through topics. For example, an API Step can emit a message to a topic, which an Event Step subscribes to and reacts upon. By chaining these connections, you create a flow—where step A triggers step B, which then triggers step C, and so on.

**Flows** provide a logical structure for organizing and managing your Steps. A Flow represents a complete automation process, grouping together the Steps that work together to achieve a specific goal.

### Key Aspects of Flows

- **Organization:** Flows help you structure complex automations by grouping related Steps, making your workflows easier to understand and manage.
- **Visualization:** Motia Workbench uses Flows to visually represent your workflows as interactive diagrams, showing the connections and event flow between Steps.
- **Context and Scope:** Flows define a context for Steps, allowing for flow-specific configurations, logging, and state management.
- **Event Namespacing:** Events are often scoped within a Flow, ensuring that events emitted in one flow are less likely to interfere with events in another.

### Example Flow Scenarios

- **Order Processing Flow:** Steps for order validation, payment processing, inventory updates, and shipping notifications.
- **User Onboarding Flow:** Steps for account creation, email verification, welcome messages, and initial setup tasks.
- **Data Synchronization Flow:** Steps for fetching data from an external source, transforming it, and updating a database.

### Virtually connecting steps

Sometimes, a workflow needs to represent actions that occur outside the Motia ecosystem—such as manual tasks or
external processes—to make the flow comprehensive and easy to understand. In these cases, you can use Noop Steps
to create virtual connections between steps, ensuring your flow remains visually and logically complete.

**Example: Content Creation Workflow**

1. Article is created by a user
2. Article needs to be reviewed by a moderator
3. The moderator approves it, making the article public and listed somewhere.

In this example, step 2 (moderator review) is a virtual connection between steps 1 and 3.
This can be represented by a Noop Step:

```
┌──────────────────┐      ┌─────────────────────┐      ┌────────────────────────────┐
│  POST /article   │ ───► │  Moderator review   │ ───► │  POST /article/:id/review  │
└──────────────────┘      └─────────────────────┘      └────────────────────────────┘
```

Without a Noop Step, the other two steps would appear disconnected, which could lead to confusion in the flow diagram.
By including a Noop Step, you maintain clarity and accurately represent the entire process, even when some actions
happen outside of Motia.

title: Quick Start
---

This guide will walk you through everything you need to define a minimal **step**, set up your Motia project, and run the **Motia** dev server – all in one go, using **pnpm** for package management.

<Steps>
  <Step>
  ### Setup your project: Create a New Project Folder

Let's create a new Motia project in a dedicated folder. This is the recommended approach for keeping your projects organized.

  <Tabs items={['Automated', 'Manual']}>
<Tab value="Automated">
  <Tabs items={['npx', 'motia Global CLI']}>
    <Tab value="npx">
      Use `npx` to run the project creation command directly:

      <Tabs items={['npx']}>
        <Tab value="npx">
          ```bash
          npx motia@latest create -n <your-project-name>
          ```
        </Tab>
      </Tabs>
    </Tab>

    <Tab value="motia Global CLI">
      **First, install the Motia CLI globally:**

      <Tabs items={['pnpm (Global)', 'npm (Global)', 'yarn (Global)', 'bun (Global)']}>
        <Tab value="pnpm (Global)">
          ```bash
          npm install -g motia
          ```
        </Tab>
        <Tab value="npm (Global)">
          ```bash
          npm install -g motia
          ```
        </Tab>
        <Tab value="yarn (Global)">
          ```bash
          yarn global add motia
          ```
        </Tab>
        <Tab value="bun (Global)">
          ```bash
          bun add -g motia
          ```
        </Tab>
      </Tabs>

      **Then, create your project using the globally installed `motia` command:**

      ```bash
      motia create -n <your-project-name>
      ```
    </Tab>

  </Tabs>

    *   **This will**:
        *   Download and run the Motia CLI project creation tool
        *   Create a new project directory named `<your-project-name>`.
        *   Set up a basic Motia project structure inside the new folder.
        *   Install necessary dependencies using pnpm within the project folder.
        *   Add a `dev` script to your `package.json`.
        *   Include example steps to get you started.

  <Callout type="info">
    **Choosing a Project Name:** Replace `<your-project-name>` with your desired project folder name.

    **Alternative Templates:** To see other templates, run: `npx motia templates` (or `motia templates` if you installed globally).

  </Callout>

You should see a new folder created with the following files inside:

  <Files>
    <Folder name="steps" defaultOpen>
      <File name="00-noop.step.ts" />
      <File name="00-noop.step.tsx" />
      <File name="01-api.step.ts" />
      <File name="02-test-state.step.ts" />
      <File name="03-check-state-change.step.ts" />
    </Folder>
    <File name="package.json" />
    <File name="tsconfig.json" />
    <File name="types.d.ts" />
  </Files>
</Tab>
    <Tab value="Manual">
      <Callout>For these instructions we recommend using `pnpm`. For detailed installation instructions and package manager options, please refer to the [Installation Guide](/docs/getting-started/installation) (Note: In this Quick Start, automated project creation is highly recommended).</Callout>

      **Quick Setup Summary (Manual - Advanced Users):**

      1.  **Create a project directory:**
          ```bash
          mkdir <your-project-name> && cd <your-project-name>
          ```

      2.  **Initialize `package.json`:**
          ```bash
          npm init -y
          ```

      3.  **Install Core Packages:**
          ```bash
            motia zod
          ```

      4.  **Add `dev` Script to `package.json`:**
          ```json
          {
            "scripts": {
              "dev": "motia dev"
            }
          }
          ```

      5.  **Optional TypeScript Setup:**
          ```bash
          ts-node typescript -D
          ```

      6.  **Create `steps` Folder:**
          ```bash
          mkdir steps
          ```
    </Tab>

  </Tabs>

  </Step>
  <Step>
  ### Minimal Step Example

**The initial project comes with sample steps, but in this step we're going to walk you through on creating a new one**

1.  **Create a new file** named `hello-world.step.js` (or `hello-world.step.ts` for TypeScript) inside the `steps` folder.

    <Files>
      <Folder name="steps" defaultOpen>
        <File name="hello-world.step.js" />
      </Folder>
    </Files>

2.  **Paste the following code** into your `hello-world.step.js` file:

        ```javascript
        exports.config = {
          type: 'api', // "event", "api", or "cron"
          path: '/hello-world',
          method: 'GET',
          name: 'HelloWorld',
          emits: [],
          flows: ['HelloWorld'],
        }

        exports.handler = async () => {
          return {
            status: 200,
            body: { message: 'Hello World' },
          }
        }
        ```
        This minimal API step creates a **GET** endpoint on `/hello-world` that returns a JSON

        ```json
        { "message": "Hello World" }
        ```

  </Step>

   <Step>

### Start Motia Development Server & Workbench

Now, let's start Motia and see your workflow in action!

1.  **Open your terminal** in your Motia project's root directory (where your `package.json` file is located).

2.  **Run the development server command:** Use the `dev` script that was set up in your `package.json`:

    <Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm', 'bun']}>
      <Tab value="yarn">```yarn run dev ```</Tab>
      <Tab value="npm">```npm run dev ```</Tab>
      <Tab value="pnpm">```pnpm run dev ```</Tab>
      <Tab value="bun">```bun run dev ```</Tab>
    </Tabs>

    Motia will:

    - **Scan** your `steps` folder for step definition files (`.step.ts`, `.step.js`, `.step.py`, `.step.rb`).
    - **Register** your Steps with the Motia runtime.
    - **Launch** a development server and the Motia Workbench UI (typically at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)).

    <Callout type="info">
      **Changing the Port:** To run the Workbench on a different port, use the `--port` option: `pnpm run dev --port
      3001`
    </Callout>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### View your Flow in the Workbench

    1.  **Open your browser** and navigate to the Motia Workbench.  By default, it's running at:  [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) or [`http://127.0.0.1:3000`](http://127.0.0.1:3000).

    2.  **Locate your Flow in the Sidebar:** On the left sidebar of the Workbench UI, you should see a list of Flows.

        *   **For the default template:**  You'll find a flow named "**default**".
        *   **For the `hello-world.step.js` example:** You'll find a flow named "**HelloWorld**".

    3.  **Select your Flow:** Click on the flow name in the sidebar.

    4.  **Observe the Visual Flow:** You should now see a visual representation of your flow in the main panel. This is the Motia Workbench visualizing the steps and event flow within your application!

        ![Flow Visualization in Workbench](./../img/hello-world-workbench.png)

        <Callout type="info">
            You can click and drag the nodes in the visual editor to rearrange them for better clarity. Explore the UI to familiarize yourself with the Workbench!
        </Callout>

    </Step>
    <Step>
    ### Test your step

    Now you created the step `hello-world.js`, which creates a **GET** `/hello-world` endpoint, you can test by either opening http://localhost:3000/hello-world or

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:3000/hello-world
    ```

    This is a really simple example where you can have your first step running.

    </Step>

    <Step>
    ### Understanding a flow with events

    Now you already created an API Steps, let's check the flow that's already in the project, click on `default` flow on Workbench sidebar on the left. (Or navigate to http://localhost:3000/flow/default)

    You should see the page below

    ![Flow Visualization in Workbench](./../img/getting-started-workbench.png)

    This flow is a little bit more advanced, it has Noop steps (which we are going to talk about later), API steps, and Event steps.

    Event steps are code that can take some time to finish and can have errors (like LLM calls which are non-deterministic), in case they fail, they can rerun later.

    In the flow represented by the image above you should see a node with a button to start it, go ahead an click it and check the logs that are generated.

    Now let's dive deep on the flow you already executed. Let's jump in to [Core concepts](/docs/getting-started/core-concepts)

## Visual Overview

Here's how the automation flow works:

<div className="my-8">![Flow: Gmail Automation Steps](../img/gmail-automation.png)</div>

## 🌊 Workflow Architecture

The Gmail Account Manager workflow consists of the following steps:

### 1. Gmail Authentication (Multi-Step Flow)
- **Files**: 
  - `steps/gmail-get-auth-url.step.ts`: Generates OAuth2 authorization URL
  - `steps/gmail-auth.step.ts`: Handles authorization code exchange
  - `steps/gmail-token-status.step.ts`: Checks token validity and refreshes if needed

### 2. Gmail Webhook (API Step)
- **File**: `steps/gmail-webhook.step.ts`
- **Purpose**: Receives notifications from Gmail when new emails arrive
- **Emits**: `gmail.new_email` event with message details

title: TLDR - Motia in 3 Minutes
description: A 3-minute overview of Motia’s core concepts with a business-ready GenAI use case
---

# TLDR - Motia in 3 Minutes

Got 3 minutes? Here’s the scoop on Motia—a code-first framework that powers event-driven workflows, perfect for Generative AI (GenAI). We’ll spotlight a real-world win: analyzing customer feedback.

## What’s Motia?
Motia builds scalable, observable workflows without infrastructure headaches. Code in JS, TS, or Python, chain it up, and track it live in a visual Workbench.

- **Why It’s Clutch**: No queue setup, instant APIs/scheduling, real-time insights.
- **Who’s It For**: Businesses wanting intelligent workflows without the hassle.

## Core Concepts in a Nutshell

| Concept    | What It Does                                                                                   | TLDR Feedback Example                        |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Steps**  | Logic blocks that catch events, process, and trigger more.                                    | “Extract sentiment,” “Flag issues,” “Notify.”|
| **Flows**  | Step groups with a goal. Your workflow’s playbook.                                            | “Feedback analyzer” flow.                    |
| **Events** | Messages bouncing between steps, hauling data and sparking action.                            | “Feedback in!” or “Issues flagged!”          |
| **Topics** | Event labels. Steps subscribe to nab what they need.                                          | “Catch ‘feedback.in’ and analyze.”           |

### How It Ties Together
Here’s a business-ready GenAI flow—crunching customer feedback:
1. An **API Step** grabs a review (e.g., `POST /feedback`).
2. It fires an **Event** with **Topic** `feedback.in`.
3. An **Event Step** uses an LLM to extract sentiment (e.g., positive/negative), emitting `sentiment.out`.
4. Another **Step** spots critical issues (e.g., “product broke”), emitting `issues.found`.
5. A final **Step** notifies the team via Slack with sentiment and issues.
6. This rolls in a **Flow** called `feedback-analyzer`, tracked in the Workbench.

## Why Businesses Love It
- **Scales Anything**: Links steps into workflows—GenAI or otherwise—with ease.
- **Language Flex**: Mix Python for analysis, TS for notifications—Motia rolls with it.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Workbench maps your flow live, logs and all, for instant clarity.

## 3-Minute Takeaway
Motia = **Steps** (logic) → **Events** (messages) → **Topics** (routing) → **Flows** (plans). It’s event-driven power made simple, with a dashboard to keep tabs.

## Core Concepts: Building Blocks of Motia

Motia workflows are built using a few core concepts that work together harmoniously:

| Concept    | Description                                                                                                |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Steps**  | Self-contained, reusable units of business logic. Steps subscribe to events, process data, and emit events. |
| **Flows**  | Logical groupings of related steps that together accomplish a specific task or process.                     |
| **Events** | Messages that are emitted by steps and trigger other steps that subscribe to them.                          |
| **Topics** | Named channels or categories for events, enabling event routing and decoupling between steps.              |

title: NOOP Steps
---

NOOP (No Operation) steps are a powerful feature in Motia that serve multiple purposes:

1. Modeling external processes, webhooks and integrations
2. Representing human-in-the-loop activities
3. Creating custom visualizations in the workbench
4. Testing flows during development

## File Structure

NOOP steps require two files with the same base name:
- `stepName.step.ts` - Contains the step configuration
- `stepName.step.tsx` - Contains the UI component (optional)

### Step Configuration File (.ts)

<Tabs items={['TS', 'JS']}>
  <Tab value="TS">
    ```typescript
    // myStep.step.ts
    import { NoopConfig } from 'motia'

    export const config: NoopConfig = {
      type: 'noop',
      name: 'My NOOP Step',
      description: 'Description of what this step simulates',
      virtualEmits: ['event.one', 'event.two'],
      virtualSubscribes: [], // Required even if empty
      flows: ['my-flow'],
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="JS">
    ```javascript
    // myStep.step.js
    const config = {
      type: 'noop',
      name: 'My NOOP Step',
      description: 'Description of what this step simulates',
      virtualEmits: ['event.one', 'event.two'],
      virtualSubscribes: [], // Required even if empty
      flows: ['my-flow'],
    }

    module.exports = { config }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### UI Component File (.tsx)

<Tabs items={['TS', 'JS']}>
  <Tab value="TS">
    ```typescript
    // myStep.step.tsx
    import React from 'react'

      return (
        <div className="p-4 bg-gray-800 rounded-lg border border-gray-600 text-white">
          <div className="text-sm font-medium">My Step UI</div>
          {/* Your custom UI elements */}
          <BaseHandle type="source" position={Position.Bottom} />

## Visualization in Workbench

NOOP steps are visually represented in the Motia Workbench with the following characteristics:

- Distinct node representation with clear input/output handles
- Visual indicators for virtual event connections
- Status indicators for waiting states
- Clear visualization of external system dependencies

## Custom UI

You can enhance your NOOP steps with custom React components for better visualization:

<Tabs  items={['TS', 'JS']}>
  <Tab value="TS">
    ```tsx
    // customNode.step.tsx
    import React from 'react'
    import { BaseHandle, EventNodeProps, Position } from 'motia/workbench'

    export default (_: EventNodeProps) => {
      return (
        <div className="p-3 px-6 flex flex-col max-w-[300px] bg-blue-500 border-white rounded-full text-white border border-solid text-center text-sm">
          <div>Custom Processing</div>
          <BaseHandle type="target" position={Position.Top} />
          <BaseHandle type="source" position={Position.Bottom} />
        </div>
      )
    }

    // customNode.step.ts
    export const config: NoopConfig = {
      type: 'noop',
      name: 'Custom Process',
      virtualEmits: ['/api/process/complete'],
      virtualSubscribes: ['process.start'],
      flows: ['custom-flow']
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="JS">
    ```jsx
    // customNode.step.jsx
    import React from 'react'
    import { BaseHandle, EventNodeProps, Position } from 'motia/workbench'

    export default (_: EventNodeProps) => {
      return (
        <div className="p-3 px-6 flex flex-col max-w-[300px] bg-blue-500 border-white rounded-full text-white border border-solid text-center text-sm">
          <div>Custom Processing</div>
          <BaseHandle type="target" position={Position.Top} />
          <BaseHandle type="source" position={Position.Bottom} />
        </div>
      )
    }

    // customNode.step.js
    const config = {
      type: 'noop',
      name: 'Custom Process',
      virtualEmits: ['/api/process/complete'],
      virtualSubscribes: ['process.start'],
      flows: ['custom-flow']
    }

    module.exports = {config};
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices

| Category | Guidelines |
|----------|------------|
| **File Organization** | • Keep configuration and UI code in separate files<br/>• Use `.step.ts` for configuration<br/>• Use `.step.tsx` for UI components |
| **UI Components** | • Use functional React components<br/>• Include proper TypeScript types<br/>• Follow Tailwind's utility classes<br/>• Keep components minimal and focused<br/>• Design clear visual connection points<br/>• Always include BaseHandle components for flow connections |
| **Configuration** | • Always include `virtualSubscribes` (even if empty)<br/>• Use descriptive names for virtual events<br/>• Include clear descriptions<br/>• Use descriptive, action-oriented names |
| **External Process Modeling** | • Document expected timeframes and SLAs<br/>• Define all possible outcomes and edge cases<br/>• Use exact API route matching |
| **Testing** | • Create isolated test flows<br/>• Use realistic test data<br/>• Handle errors gracefully<br/>• Implement clear status indicators<br/>• Label test steps explicitly<br/>• Provide visual feedback for actions |

## Component Reference

### Core Imports

| Import | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `BaseHandle` | A React component that renders connection points for nodes in the workflow. Used to define where edges (connections) can start or end on a node. |
| `EventNodeProps` | (TypeScript only) Interface defining the properties passed to node components, including node data, selected state, and connection information. |
| `Position` | (TypeScript only) Enum that specifies the possible positions for handles on a node (Top, Right, Bottom, Left). Used to control where connection points appear. |

### Handle Placement

| Handle Type | Position | 
|------------|----------|
| Input Handles | Position.Top |
| Output Handles | Position.Bottom |
| Flow Direction | Top to bottom |

### Styling Guidelines

| Category | Guidelines |
|----------|------------|
| Colors | Use semantic colors to indicate state (success, error, pending) |
| States | • Implement clear visual indicators for active/inactive states<br/>• Use subtle animations for state transitions |
| Design System | • Follow your project's design tokens<br/>• Maintain consistent spacing and padding<br/>• Use standard border radiuses<br/>• Ensure high contrast for readability<br/>• Use consistent font sizes (14px-16px) |

Motia Workbench is a development platform that helps you build and debug your Motia flows. It serves as your control center where you can:

- Visualize flows as interactive diagrams
- Test steps directly in the UI
- Monitor real-time logs
- Debug issues

![Flow Visualization in Workbench](./../img/demo-workbench.png)

## Getting Started

Start workbench by running:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm', 'bun']}>
  <Tab value="pnpm">```pnpm run dev ```</Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">```yarn run dev ```</Tab>
  <Tab value="npm">```npm run dev ```</Tab>
  <Tab value="bun">```bun run dev ```</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout>
  Running the dev command starts: - **Motia Server**: Backend services and API endpoints - **Motia Workbench**: Web
  interface at http://localhost:3000 - **Development Mode**: Auto-reloads when changes are made
</Callout>

## Key Features

<Steps>
  <Step>
  ### Flow Visualization
  See your entire flow as an interactive diagram:
  - Steps appear as connected nodes
  - API endpoints are highlighted as entry points
  - Event connections show data flow
  - Click any step to see its details
  </Step>

<Step>
  ### Real-time Testing Test your flows directly in the interface: - Send test requests to API endpoints - Monitor how
  events flow through steps - Visualize step sequence execution - Inspect data at each stage
</Step>

<Step>
  ### Live Logs Monitor your flow execution: ``` [INFO] [payment-flow] Payment received: $50.00 [DEBUG] [payment-flow]
  Processing payment... ```
</Step>

  <Step>
   ### Development Tools
  - **Hot Reload**: Changes reflect immediately in the UI
  - **Error Handling**: Detailed error messages with contextual debugging information
  - **State Inspector**: Real-time monitoring of state management
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Customization

Motia Workbench allows you to customize how your steps appear in the Workbench flow visualization tool.

### NOOP Steps

NOOP (No Operation) steps represent virtual points in your flow where external actions occur:

- Human approvals or reviews
- Webhook callbacks
- External system integrations
- Manual interventions

These steps help visualize important external touchpoints without implementing actual logic.

### UI Steps

UI steps allow you to customize how your steps appear in the Workbench visualization:

- Override the default layout of Event steps
- Customize API endpoint representations
- Modify how Cron jobs are displayed
- Add custom icons and styling

UI Steps provide a powerful way to create custom, visually appealing representations of your workflow steps in the Workbench flow visualization tool.

With UI Steps, you can enhance the user experience by designing intuitive, context-aware visual components that clearly communicate your flow's sequencing and events.

## Overview

To create a custom UI for a step, create a `.tsx` or `.jsx` file next to your step file with the same base name:

<Tabs items={['tsx', 'jsx']}>
  <Tab value="tsx">
    ``` 
    steps/ 
    └── myStep/ 
      ├── myStep.step.ts      # Step definition
      └── myStep.step.tsx     # Visual override
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="jsx">
    ```
    steps/
      └── myStep/
      ├── myStep.step.js      # Step definition
      └── myStep.step.jsx     # Visual override
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Basic Usage

Let's override an EventNode but keeping the same look. Like the image below.
We're going to add an image on the side and show the description.

![Custom Event Node](./../img/custom-event-node.png)

<Tabs items={['TypeScript', 'JavaScript']}>
  <Tab>
    ```tsx
    // myStep.step.tsx

    import { EventNode, EventNodeProps } from 'motia/workbench'
    import React from 'react'

    export const Node: React.FC<EventNodeProps> = (props) => {
      return (
        <EventNode {...props}>
          <div className="flex flex-row items-start gap-2">
            <div className="text-sm text-gray-400 font-mono">{props.data.description}</div>
            <img
              style={{ width: '64px', height: '64px' }}
              src="https://www.motia.dev/icon.png"
            />
          </div>
        </EventNode>
      )
    }
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```jsx
    // myStep.step.jsx

    import { EventNode } from 'motia/workbench'
    import React from 'react'

    export const Node = (props) => {
      return (
        <EventNode {...props}>
          <div className="flex flex-row items-start gap-2">
            <div className="text-sm text-gray-400 font-mono">{props.data.description}</div>
            <img
              style={{ width: '64px', height: '64px' }}
              src="https://www.motia.dev/icon.png"
            />
          </div>
        </EventNode>
      )
    }
    ```

    

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Components

Motia Workbench provides out of the box components that you can use to create custom UI steps, which apply to different types of steps.


| Component   | Props Type     | Description                                                                    |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| EventNode   | EventNodeProps | Base component for Event Steps, with built-in styling and connection points    |
| ApiNode     | ApiNodeProps   | Component for API Steps, includes request/response visualization capabilities  |
| CronNode    | CronNodeProps  | Base component for Cron Steps, displays timing information                     |
| NoopNode    | NoopNodeProps  | Base component for NoopNodes with a different color to comply workbench legend |

## Customizing completely

You can also fully customize your node making it look completely different from the result.
Let's draw the following node.

![Custom Ideator Agent Node](./../img/custom-ideator-agent-node.png)

```tsx
import { BaseHandle, EventNodeProps, Position } from 'motia/workbench'
import React from 'react'

export const Node: React.FC<EventNodeProps> = (props) => {
  return (
    <div className="w-80 bg-black text-white rounded-xl p-4">
      <div className="group relative">
        <BaseHandle type="target" position={Position.Top} variant="event" />

        <div className="flex items-center space-x-3">
          <img className="w-8 h-8" src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/12222/12222588.png" />
          <div className="text-lg font-semibold">{props.data.name}</div>
        </div>

        <div className="mt-2 text-sm font-medium text-gray-300">{props.data.description}</div>

        <div className="mt-3 flex flex-col gap-2 border border-gray-800 border-solid p-2 rounded-md w-full">

        <BaseHandle type="source" position={Position.Bottom} variant="event" />
      </div>
    </div>

}
```

### Important Notes

- You will need to add `<BaseHandle>` to your node, otherwize it won't show the connectors.
- If your node has padding, make sure to add a group inside your node with class `group relative` so the handles can be correctly positioned.
